Code4Brownies is a software that allows instructors and students share codes in real time during a lecture or study session.
Traditionally, coding is a very lonely process.  Pair programming was found to be helpful.  Current computational thinking practices encourage communication and collaboration during the problem solving process.  This is why Code4Brownies was created.

## Basic Workflow

+ Instructor runs the server on his/her laptop in class. The server provides the IP address.

+ Students and instructor set the IP address in Sublime Text 3 (ST3).

+ To share codes in a current ST3 window, instructor can broadcast his code.  To get the instructor's broadcast content, a student selects "Whiteboard" on the ST3 menu.

+ To share codes in a current ST3 window, a student selects "Share" on the ST3 menu.  Instructor can get codes from students by selecting "Get All".

+ Instructor can give a brownie point to a student based on his/her submission.

+ When instructor terminates the server, brownie points are saved to a local file.
