Code4Brownies is a software that allows instructors and students share codes in real time during a lecture or study session.

The setting is basically as follows:

+ Instructor and students install [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).

+ Instructor runs the server on his or her laptop and informs students of the server IP address.

+ Students and instructor set the IP address.  ["Set information" on the menu]

+ Instructor writes codes in his editor.  He can broadcast his code in the current window of his editor to all students if he wants.

+ To get the broadcast content, each student can select "Whiteboard" on the menu.

+ Each student writes codes in his/her editor.  He/She can share the codes in the current window to the instructor by selecting "Share" on the menu.

+ Instructor can get all codes from students by selecting "Get All".

+ Instructor can give a brownie point to a student based on his/her submission.

+ When instructor terminates the server, brownie points are saved to a local file.
